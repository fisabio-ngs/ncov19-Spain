# Consortium for Genomic Epidemiology of Pathogens

**NextSpain** is a publicly funded initiative to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of results on the epidemiology and evolution of microbial pathogens in Spain to contribute to informed decisions during epidemics and outbreaks. *NextSpain* hosts the results from molecular and genomic epidemiology analyses from different Spanish research group on several pathogens following the procedures established by [NextStrain](http://nextstrain.org). This site was launched during the COVID-19 pandemics and it will progressively incorporate the results for other pathogens, regardless their deposit in [GISAID](www.gisaid.org) or other publicly accessible databases.

- [NextSpain COVID-19](https://nextstrain.org/groups/nextspain/ncov19-Spain) shows the results obtained from the analysis of complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 deposited in [GISAID](www.gisaid.org) or other publicly accessible databases. The analyses are performed with the [NextStrain](http://nexstrain.org) engine to inform the scientific community and the general society about the genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 in Spain: [SeqCOVID Genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 in Spain](http://seqcovid.csic.es/).
