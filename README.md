# NextSpain (web page under development)

NextSpain is a publicly funded initiative contributing to better understanding and decision making during epidemics. We offer a continually-updated view of genomic sequences of COVID-19 based on [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) engine to inform the scientific community about the molecular epidemiology of the disease in Spain. Epidemiological relationships are currently based on sequences deposited in [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) database.
